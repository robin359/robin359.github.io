<h1>Hybrider Krieg</h1>
<h2>Und was er ver√§ndert</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The sense of this website is first of all sharing experiences. So far I kept myself busy with understanding the world we live in. on this way I leasrned a lot of different things, but most important:
     On this way I made a lot of mistakes. Mistakes I shouldn't have made if I had a guide or a mentor, that accompanied on my way, helped and inspired me.</p>
<p>So my first goal is to give you advice on how to tackle a new project no matter if it's learning to code, changing habits or playing an instrument. I will be there for you because I went through all of this.</p>
