<h2>May I introduce</h2>
<p>Welcome to my blog! I'm glad you found the way to me. 
    Here you will find my inner voice, my thoughts and my visions combined in various topics distributed in different fields of todays life.</p>
<p>The sense of this website is first of all sharing experiences. So far I kept myself busy with understanding the world we live in. on this way I leasrned a lot of different things, but most important:
     On this way I made a lot of mistakes. Mistakes I shouldn't have made if I had a guide or a mentor, that accompanied on my way, helped and inspired me.</p>
<p>So my first goal is to give you advice on how to tackle a new project no matter if it's learning to code, changing habits or playing an instrument. I will be there for you because I went through all of this.</p>
